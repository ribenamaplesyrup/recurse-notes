    "Online radio plays a major role in how I discover new music. I really dig how uniquely curated shows are and find myself studying tracklists, chasing down labels and trying to discern new moods and scenes from within the selections. I'd now like to explore augmenting how I discover new music through automating some of the following processes:\n",

    "- finding significant periods of history to mine for music\n",
    "- finding artists who perform at the same events\n",

    "I will begin by scraping useful metadata from a single online radio station. NTS radio is an obvious choice for me as its one of the most popular online stations, has many of my favourite regular show, has some of the metadata I need already included (record labels, tracklists) and has a website that looks reasonably straightforward to scrape."
